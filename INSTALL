What the..?
-----------
pytelemeter is a small Python "Telemeter" application to check out Telenet's download/upload statistics.

Depends:
--------
Python >= 2.2.x (http://www.python.org)
	(If it works with older versions of Python, let me know)
PyGTK >= 2.0.0 (http://www.daa.com.au/~james/pygtk/)
	(Only if you want to use the GTK interface)
ClientCookie >= 0.4.13 (http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/ClientCookie/)
	(Older versions of ClientCookie <= 0.4.9 could work, but are no longer supported)

Installation
------------
* You need to be root to install pytelemeter. If you don't have root, just copy all .py
  files in the distribution into a dir and run in from that dir.
* Installation is simple, just run as root (using sudo is even better, but this should always work):

python setup.py install

Manual installation
-------------------
If the installation procedure with setup.py fails, you can try installing it manually.
Note that if setup.py fails, you should file a bug report to me.

cp scripts/* /usr/local/bin
cp lib/* /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/

Why use setup.py if this is easy as well? Well, setup.py is the standard Python way of installing things,
so this makes the lives of packagers easier. Use what you want.

Setting up for use
------------------
* Log on with your normal user account to set up a config file:

cp pytelemeterrc ~/.pytelemeterrc

* Now Edit ~/.pytelemeterrc to match your Telenet login and password.
* Last but not least, chmod your config file to safe permissions:

chmod 600 ~/.pytelemeterrc

* Now run pytelemeter-gtk or pytelemeter-cli (add -h to view options).
