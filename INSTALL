What the..?
-----------
pytelemeter is a small Python "Telemeter" application to check out Telenet's download/upload statistics.

Depends:
--------
Python >= 2.2.x (http://www.python.org)
	(If it works with older versions of Python, let me know)
PyGTK >= 2.0.0 (http://www.daa.com.au/~james/pygtk/)
	(Only if you want to use the GTK interface)

Installation
------------
You need to be root to install pytelemeter. If you don't have root, just copy all .py files in the distribution into a dir and run it from that dir.
Just run as root (using sudo is even better, but this should always work):

python setup.py install

Setting up for use
------------------
* Log on with your normal user account to set up a config file:

cp pytelemeterrc ~/.pytelemeterrc

* Now Edit ~/.pytelemeterrc to match your Telenet login and password.
* Last but not least, chmod your config file to safe permissions:

chmod 600 ~/.pytelemeterrc

* Now run pytelemeter-gtk or pytelemeter-cli (add -h to view options).

If you have any problems, first check the FAQ items on the website.
