IMPORTANT: This software no longer works.
I just uploaded it here to have the code available and to remember how 
young I really was. Perhaps one day I will revive this code but in the
meanwhile, feel free to fork it.

Start Here
----------
First, make sure you agree to all the terms stated in the COPYING file.
Comments or suggestions are welcome on the project mailinglist
<pytelemeter-support@lists.sourceforge.net>, to contact the individual
developers see the AUTHORS file.


What the ...?
-------------
pytelemeter is a small Python application to fetch bandwidth usage
statistics from the Belgian ISP Telenet.

Telenet is one of the largest internet providers in Belgium. Like any
other ISP in these regions, it imposes some limits on its home user's
bandwidth usage, depending mostly on the monthly fee.
The standard way users can follow up on their usage is the ISP's
website, but that generally involves a lot of clicking.

pytelemeter provides some additional, more convenient interfaces to
access these bandwidth statistics. There is a non-interactive command
line frontend, a graphical one based on the GTK toolkit and a
freedesktop.org compliant system tray icon.


Dependencies
------------
needed:
  * Python >= 2.2 <http://www.python.org>

optional:
  * PyGTK >= 2.0 <http://www.pygtk.org>
    - only if you want to use the GTK interface
    - glade support must be included (debian package: python-glade2)
    - gnome-python-extras needed for systray support
  * SOAPpy <http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/> and
    PyXML >= 0.8.3 <http://pyxml.sourceforge.net>
    - only needed for the Telemeter4Tools parser


Installation
------------
You must have root privileges to install pytelemeter the standard way:

 $ sudo python setup.py install
  or
 # python setup.py install

When root access is not an option, adding the location (parent dir) of
the module directory to the sys.path should make the cli work, and
changing the path to the glade and icon files should do the rest.
Making non-root installation easier is on the TODO list.


Setting up for use
------------------
This application needs a proper configuration file containing your
Telenet username and password. The GUI variants of pytelemeter now
provide an interface to handle the configfile, but you can still set it
up manually if you want:

* log on with your normal user account (you weren't planning on running
  pytelemeter as root, were you...)
* copy the example pytelemeterrc to ~/.pytelemeterrc
* edit ~/.pytelemeterrc to match your Telenet username and password
* last but not least, protect it from other users on the system:
  $ chmod 600 ~/.pytelemeterrc
* now run pytelemeter -h for more
